# wasi-logger

`wasi-logger` provides a [`Logger`] implementing the [`log::Log`] logging API, which is backed by the [`wasi:logging/logging`] WIT interface.

## Usage

To use the [`Logger`] as a logger, it first needs to be installed once in the top-level WASM component using [`Logger::install`], e.g. in a `main` function, a ctor, or using a [`std::sync::OnceLock`]. Remember to also set the global logging max level using [`log::set_max_level`] to ensure that log entries created with [`log::log!`] and others are actually recorded.

```rust
#[macro_use]
extern crate log;

extern crate wasi_logger;

fn main() {
    wasi_logger::Logger::install().expect("failed to install wasi_logger::Logger");
    log::set_max_level(log::LevelFilter::Info);

    error!("Something went really wrong with {x} / {y}", x=42, y=0);
    info!(target: "my-target", "This is good to know and has a custom target");
    debug!("This message is not recorded as the trace level is currently disabled");
}
```

## Features

* The `kv` feature transitively enables `log/kv` and includes the key-value pairs in a log record in the log message.
